BUSINESS RULES & SCHEDULING LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------

Rule 1: Priority-Based Scheduling
- If multiple clients request the same trainer and time slot:
  - Use client priority score to resolve conflicts
  - Highest-value client gets the slot

Rule 2: High-Value Client Override
- If Client B already scheduled a training session for multiple trainees
- And Client A (higher priority) requests the same slot:
  - Allocate the slot to Client A
  - Notify Client B with reason
  - Offer alternative time slots to Client B
  - Notify Trainer and Admin

Rule 3: Trainee Assignment Handling
- If training is rescheduled or cancelled:
  - Update all affected trainees
  - Maintain historical logs for audit and reporting

Rule 4: Notification System
- Notifications for:
  - Trainer
  - Trainee
  - Client
  - Admin
- Notification types:
  - Informational
  - Warning
  - Action required
